## Security

- **HTTPS**: All pages and forms are served over HTTPS for encrypted communication.
- **Session Security**: Session cookies are set with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, and session configuration is centralized in `bootstrap.php`.
- **Brute Force Protection**: Login attempts are rate-limited with a lockout countdown and visual feedback.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` and verified with `password_verify()`.
- **Centralized Initialization**: All entry points include `bootstrap.php` to enforce consistent security and DB connection.

## Database & Triggers

- **MySQL Triggers**: The application uses SQL triggers to automatically manage related records when students are created, updated, or deleted. This ensures data consistency and reduces the risk of orphaned or inconsistent data.
- **Schema**: See `/schema.sql` for table definitions and trigger logic.

## Technologies Used

- PHP 7+
- MySQL
- jQuery + AJAX
- Bootstrap 4
- HTML5/CSS3

# Project Workflow

This section explains the typical workflow of the **Business First English Center** web application, from user entry to feature usage, covering both user experience and system processes.

---

## 1. **User Access and Entry Point**

- Users (Admins, Teachers, Students, or Visitors) access the application via the main entry point:  
  `public/index.php`
- The application enforces secure session management by setting strict session cookie parameters before starting the session.
- The header (`views/header.php`) is included, providing navigation and login/logout controls based on session state.

---

## 2. **Authentication and Role-Based Access**

- **Visitors** can browse public information and view available courses and services.
- **Login Modal**:  
  - Users can log in via a modal form in the header.
  - Credentials are submitted (typically via AJAX) and validated against the database.
  - Upon successful login, the session is updated with user information and role (`lvl`).
- **Role-Based Navigation**:  
  - The navigation bar dynamically changes based on the user's role:
    - **Admin**: Access to admin dashboard and management features.
    - **Teacher**: Access to teacher dashboard and class/grade management.
    - **Student**: Access to student dashboard and personal grades/schedule.

---

## 3. **Feature Access and Core Functionality**

- **Class Management** (Admins):
  - Create, edit, assign, and delete classes.
  - Assign teachers and students to classes.
- **Grade Book** (Teachers):
  - Record, update, and view student grades for each trimester.
- **Schedule Management** (Admins/Teachers):
  - Assign and view daily class schedules.
- **Student Portal**:
  - View assigned classes, schedules, and grades.

---

## 4. **Data Flow and Persistence**

- All data operations (CRUD) are handled by controllers in src/controllers/.
- Business logic and database interactions are managed by models in src/models/.
- Data is stored in a MySQL database, with triggers enforcing integrity for student records.
- AJAX is used for dynamic updates and form submissions, providing a responsive user experience.
- All AJAX handlers (for admin, teacher, and student dashboards) are located in /includes/ and follow best practices with PHPDoc and input validation.

---

## 5. **Security and Best Practices**

- **HTTPS** is enforced for all data transmission.
- **Session Security**:  
  - Cookies are set as `HttpOnly` and `Secure` (when using HTTPS).
  - Session management prevents unauthorized access.
- **Brute Force Protection**:  
  - Login attempts are rate-limited and lockouts are enforced after repeated failures.
- **Role-Based Access Control**:  
  - Each user role has access only to permitted features and views.
- **Input Validation**:
  - All AJAX handlers and forms validate input and handle errors gracefully.
- **Code Documentation**:
  - All major PHP and JavaScript files include PHPDoc/JSDoc comments for maintainability.
---

## 6. **Frontend and User Experience**

- **Responsive Design**:  
  - The UI is built with Bootstrap 4 for compatibility across devices.
- **Reusable Views**:  
  - Common UI components (header, footer, modals) are included across pages for consistency.
- **Dynamic Content**:  
  - jQuery and AJAX are used for interactive elements and real-time updates.
- **AJAX Handlers**:
  - All dashboard tables (users, classes, grades, schedules) are loaded and updated via AJAX for a seamless experience.
---


## 7. **Typical User Workflow Example**

1. **Visitor** lands on the homepage and browses available courses.
2. **User** clicks "Iniciar Sesión" and logs in.
3. **System** authenticates and redirects user to their dashboard based on role.
4. **Admin** manages classes, teachers, and students.
5. **Teacher** records grades and manages class schedules.
6. **Student** views their grades and class schedule.
7. **All users** can log out securely, ending their session.
